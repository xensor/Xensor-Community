# Xensor-Community
Xensor Community is a network of communities for all of our members to interact with. We allow all members to join each and every one of our communities. We do not charge for membership, but some communities do offer paid memberships.

## Xensor Community Center

A community center is a place where our members can come and get updates on our networks and see what we offer. We also keep track of our members through this site. Our staff works for all communities unless stated otherwise.

We would whether do what we can to make our members feel welcome than to worry more about money or anything else. We do care about our members and community.

### Membership

Each of our communities have a membership. They range from different types. Some have a paid membership that our members can upgrade to and some are just free memberships. All of our communities have a free membership that everyone can sign up for. The paid memberships are optional and are not required to enjoy our site(s).

We will post whether or not the community offers paid memberships or not. This way you will know if it has the option to upgrade or not
